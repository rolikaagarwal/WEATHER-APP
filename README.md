# Weather App
I have created a simple weather application that fetches and displays the current weather information for a given location. The application utilizes an API to retrieve weather data and presents it in a user-friendly manner.

Here's an overview of the features and functionality implemented in the weather application:

- `User Interface:` The application has a clean and intuitive user interface that allows users to enter a location.

- `API Integration`: The application fetches weather data from a weather API. I have used the OpenWeatherMap API for this purpose. The API provides real-time weather data for various locations worldwide.

- `Weather Information:` The application displays the following weather information for the entered location:

Current temperature,
Weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, etc.),
Humidity,
Wind speed 

- `User-Friendly Presentation:` The weather information is presented in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format. Appropriate weather icons or images are displayed based on the weather condition, enhancing the user experience.

- `Error Handling:` The application handles errors gracefully. If the API request fails or if the entered location is not found, meaningful error messages are displayed to the user, ensuring a smooth user experience.
## Additional Libraries and Frameworks
- None 
- Justification:

No additional libraries or frameworks were used in this implementation. The core technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) were deemed sufficient to fulfill the requirements and maintain a lightweight project.
The decision to use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any extra libraries or frameworks was made to keep things simple, flexible, and lightweight.

- Simplicity: By sticking to the basic technologies, we keep the project straightforward and easy to understand. We avoid adding unnecessary complications or dependencies, making it easier for developers to work with the code.

- Flexibility: Using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript gives us more freedom to customize and improve the project in the future. We have complete control over the code and can modify and extend it according to our specific needs without being limited by external libraries or frameworks.

- Lightweight: Not using additional libraries or frameworks helps us reduce the overall size of the application. This means the app will load faster and perform better, providing a smoother user experience.

While there are many libraries and frameworks available that could simplify development or offer extra features, it's important to consider the specific requirements of the project.
