# Weather App
## Additional Libraries and Frameworks
- None .
- Justification:

No additional libraries or frameworks were used in this implementation. The core technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) were deemed sufficient to fulfill the requirements and maintain a lightweight project.
The decision to use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any extra libraries or frameworks was made to keep things simple, flexible, and lightweight.

- Simplicity: By sticking to the basic technologies, we keep the project straightforward and easy to understand. We avoid adding unnecessary complications or dependencies, making it easier for developers to work with the code.

- Flexibility: Using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript gives us more freedom to customize and improve the project in the future. We have complete control over the code and can modify and extend it according to our specific needs without being limited by external libraries or frameworks.

- Lightweight: Not using additional libraries or frameworks helps us reduce the overall size of the application. This means the app will load faster and perform better, providing a smoother user experience.

While there are many libraries and frameworks available that could simplify development or offer extra features, it's important to consider the specific requirements of the project. In this case, we can meet the needs of the Weather App effectively using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without relying on external tools.
